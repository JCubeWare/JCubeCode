JCubeCode (shortened to JCC) is an all-in-one toolkit with a C89 library,
package manager, cross-platform utilities, scripting enviroment, data format and
build system.

It simplifies C programming by introducing an improved and more readable syntax,
creating modules that natively interact with operating systems API to reduce
dependency hell and comes with its own suite of programs to allow scripts to be
more easily written.

JCC primarily targets low-end machines and embedded chips with a hard focus on
ease of use, portability, energy efficiency and compatibility with old projects.
