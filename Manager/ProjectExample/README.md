# Example Project

This is a [JCubeCode](https://jcubeware.com/jcubecode) project template.
If you're seeing this file, you have succesfully created a project using the
command line interface via `jcc init`.

## 📦 Getting Started 📦

First, test if your settings are correct and do the following.

```bash
jcc build
jcc run
```

If you see "Hello world!", that ensures that the base JCubeCode suite was 
installed succesfully and you have yourself a supported compiler!

JCubeCode is built with C89 as a basis, so keep that in mind.

You can start editing the output by modifying `Main.jcc` and rebuilding the
code using `jcc build`.

Project settings are saved in JCD (JCubeData) format. To edit it either use the
`jcdata` utility or manually via your favorite text editor of choice.
